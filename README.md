# Visualizing-and-Understanding-Convolutional-neural-networks

This is a straight from scratch implementation of paper "Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional neural networks"-Matthew D. Zeiler and Rob Fergus (https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/papers/zeilerECCV2014.pdf)

This implementation is using keras with tensorflow backend.

The implementation is mainly divided into two parts-
1) Feature visualization with Deconvnet.
2) Occlusion Sensitivity.

**Part 1- Feature visualization with Deconvnet**
 This is described in notebook "Feature visualization using Deconvnets in Keras". Here the term deconvolution refers to transpose           convolution.
